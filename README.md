#### Description of the project: 
Over 200 different countries entered the qualification process for the 2018 Féderation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup. Thirty-two teams qualified for the tournament, with France winning the ultimate prize for the second time since the first World Cup in 1930. FIFA has previously required that players have citizenship in the country that they wish to represent, but now requires that players demonstrate a “clear connection” to said country. The purpose of this project was to examine the relationships between a very wide variety of country-level markers including those of physical player skill, national purchasing power, generosity of the people, social support, and additional measures which in the fabric of life itself could be connecting with and influencing qualification and performance at the FIFA World Cup.

#### Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers:
Our main question was if there exists a relationship between the average physical and emotional health of a countries population and the performance quality at an international sports tournament, here the FIFA World Cup. Our process was evolutionary, stepping through exploratory data analysis, identifying correlations, using the Apriori algorithm to determine frequency sets from high values, Machine learning was explored using resultant determinations to understand possible predictability of the data.
Classification was used to assess the relationship between qualification and markers of health and happiness with moderate success (accuracy: 72%, precision: 39% recall: 61%). Regression analysis of these markers with goals and wins yielded low R^2, values, although significant attributes (p<0.05) were found (life expectancy, positive affect). 

#### Application of Knowledge:
We were looking to find an association of world cup performance into life, which required a high level of abstraction in our data and analysis. Observing patterns and connections in this way creates a creative inquisition which can illuminate new insights into a well-known problem space. Applications in sports psychology, coaching, and performance at the national level are numerous. Correlations between country markers and performance might expand sport psychologists approaches to help players develop a successful, out-of-the-box mindset.
